  Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript.

1.Objects in JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript.

2.Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.

3.Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value. That reference or pointer 
  points to the location in memory where the object is stored.

4.Loosely speaking, objects in JavaScript may be defined as an unordered collection of related data, 
  of primitive or reference types, in the form of “key: value” pairs. 

5.If your object is a student, it will have properties like name, age, address, id, etc 
  and methods like updateAddress, updateNam, etc.
Example:
       var myCar = new Object();
       myCar.make = 'Ford';
       myCar.model = 'Mustang';
       myCar.year = 1969;

6.Creating Objects In JavaScript :

     let bike = {name: 'SuperSport', maker:'Ducati', engine:'937cc'};

7.Using the JavaScript Keyword new:
       
      var person = new Object();
      person.firstName = “John”;
      person.lastName = “Doe”;
      person.age = 50;
      person.eyeColor = “blue”;

8.Create JavaScript Object with Constructor

     function Vehicle(name, maker) {
     this.name = name;
     this.maker = maker;
        }
     let car1 = new Vehicle(’Fiesta’, 'Ford’);
     let car2 = new Vehicle(’Santa Fe’, 'Hyundai’)
     console.log(car1.name);  
     console.log(car2.name);
