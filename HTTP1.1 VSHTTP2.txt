  The communication protocol – your aid in reaching World Wide Web – needs no introduction today.

2.HTTP protocol was developed in 1989 as the common language that enables client and server machines’ interaction. Process steps are as enlisted.

3.While its initial version 1.1 is still the most extensively implemented protocol, it surely has its disadvantages today.
 
4.That’s what HTTP/2 came into being. This version addresses most of the shortcomings of HTTP v1.1.

5.It will define HTTP/2, why it was needed, what are its advantages, why could it be disadvantageous, alongside 
  the key differences between HTTP/2 and HTTP/1.1.

   HTTP1.1

1.The client (browser) has to send a request to the server using the method (GET/POST).

2.Server responds with the requested resource, for example – image, alongside the status of what it did to the client’s request.

3.This request-response exchange can be regarded as an IP stack being handled by transfer layer and networking layers 
  before finally reaching to the application layer.

   HTTP2

1.The major feature that differentiates HTTP/2 from HTTP/1.1 is the binary framing layer.

2. Unlike HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 uses a binary framing layer. This layer encapsulates messages – converted to its binary equivalent – while making
   sure that its HTTP semantics (method details, header information, etc.) remain untamed.

3.This feature of HTTP/2 enables gRPC to use lesser resources.
